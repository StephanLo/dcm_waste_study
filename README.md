THis repository contains R scripts used in the analysis for the article:

> Louw, A.S., Avtar, R., 2025. Methodology for measuring landfill dumping statistics globally using Digital Elevation Change maps. Resources, Conservation and Recycling 212, 107924. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2024.107924

The scripts 
- download TDM30 DCM (DEM Change Map) data from the DLR (https://geoservice.dlr.de/web/dataguide/tdm30/), according to gpkg/shp supplied for target area.
- Calculate rate of volumetric changes inside an AOI between 2 change maps in the TDM30 DCM dataset.
- In the study, applied to landfill/dumping sites to estimate the amount of waste dumped over time. 


The code requires data to be downloaded, and the working directory and file paths to be modified in the scripts, so cannot be used directly. The code is thus supplied primarily for reference. 
But, please use the "Issues" dialog to ask for any assistance with errors, etc.

And, please consider citing the article if used. Thank you!
